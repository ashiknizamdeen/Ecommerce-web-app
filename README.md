## About the Project

Retail Ridge is a modern, responsive, and user-friendly e-commerce website designed for fashion and lifestyle products. It features a clean design, product filtering, and an interactive shopping cart experience. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates fundamental front-end development skills without relying on external frameworks or libraries.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase a functional e-commerce front-end, allowing users to browse products, add them to a cart, and simulate a checkout process.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using CSS media queries.
*   **Sticky Header:** Navigation bar remains visible at the top of the page while scrolling.
*   **Hero Section:** Engaging full-width banner with a call to action.
*   **Product Display:** Grid layout for showcasing products with images, titles, descriptions, and prices.
*   **Product Filtering:** Filter products by category (All, Clothing, Accessories, Electronics, Home) using interactive tabs.
*   **Interactive Shopping Cart:**

*   **Smooth Scrolling:** Navigation links provide a smooth scroll experience to different sections of the page.
*   **Add to Cart Feedback:** Visual notification when an item is successfully added to the cart.
*   **Simulated Checkout:** A basic alert-based checkout summary (no actual payment processing).
*   **Footer:** Comprehensive footer with quick links, customer service information, and contact details.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and responsive design.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive elements, dynamic content, product filtering, and shopping cart functionality.
